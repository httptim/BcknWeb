// Present a warning to the user warning about the dangers of Self-XSS.
// Shamelessly based on Facebook and Discord's warning.
//
// REVIEW: There's an interesting article debating whether a warning is the best
//         way forward. Since this is sort of a cryptocurrency app, and we deal
//         with far too many midiots on a daily basis, I figured that a
//         semi-aggressive warning is probably going to be better in the long
//         run. That said, this is still a pretty good read:
